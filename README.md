## Why I built this

If you've participated in GSSoC 2026, you already know the pain. The official leaderboard throws a "tracker not accessible" error half the time, and when it does load, it only counts PRs from officially registered GSSoC repos. So if you contributed to a repo that wasn't on their list, those PRs simply don't show up — even if they had all the right labels.

I built this for myself. I wanted to see all my labelled PRs in one place, understand exactly how my score was calculated, and track how my rank moved over time without refreshing the official site every hour. Once it was working, I cleaned it up and made it public so other participants could use it too.

## What it does

You enter any GitHub username and the tracker pulls all their public PRs that carry GSSoC labels — `gssoc:approved`, `level:*`, `quality:*`, `type:*` — and calculates a score using the official formula:

```
Score = 50 + (difficulty × quality multiplier) + type bonus
```

It shows you your total points, rank trend, label distribution, and a full breakdown of every PR that contributed to your score. There's also a chart so you can see how your points grew over time.

The key difference from the official tracker — **this one is not limited to registered repos**. It reads all your public PRs with GSSoC labels, so your score here might be higher than what the official leaderboard shows.

## Important note

This is an independent community tool. The scores shown here **may differ from the official GSSoC leaderboard** because this tracker counts PRs from all repos, not just the ones officially registered with GSSoC. For official standings, always refer to the GSSoC leaderboard directly.

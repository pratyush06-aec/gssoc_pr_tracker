            GSSoC Tracker is a personal analytics tool built by a GSSoC 2026 participant. You enter a GitHub username and it shows you your contribution stats in a way the official leaderboard does not.
          </P>
          <P>Here is exactly what happens when you search a username:</P>
          <Bullets items={[
            "Your public pull requests are fetched from the GitHub API",

          <P>
            Results are <Bright>cached for up to 5 minutes</Bright> on Vercel&apos;s servers to reduce GitHub API load. After that window the data is gone. Nothing is stored long term, and nothing is sold.

          <Note>
            <strong>We now filter to the 421 officially registered GSSoC 2026 projects.</strong> Your score here reflects only PRs in repos on that list — the same set the official leaderboard uses.
          </Note>
          <P>
            We fetch the project list directly from <Bright>gssoc.girlscript.org/api/projects</Bright> and check every PR against it. If a repo is not on the list, that PR does not appear in your tracker and does not count toward your score here.
          </P>
          <P>
            The <Hi>PR Validator</Hi> at <Bright>/pr-check</Bright> lets you paste any PR link and see exactly which category it falls into — valid, unofficial, not approved, and so on. It also shows the full points breakdown for that specific PR.
          </P>
          <P>
            One thing to keep in mind: the official list is updated as new projects get approved during the programme. We refresh our local copy periodically. If a repo was added recently and your PR is not showing up, try again in a day or two.

        <Section icon={<ExternalLink size={15} color="rgba(255,255,255,0.6)" />} title="Why this was built">
          <P>
            The official GSSoC leaderboard takes a long time to load, and that makes sense. It is processing contributions across 45,000+ participants, filtering specifically to registered project repos, and doing that at scale. That is a hard problem and the delay is understandable.
          </P>
          <P>
            But as a contributor, I just wanted a fast personal view of my own PRs, with labels, charts, and a breakdown I could actually read. So I built it for myself.
          </P>
          <P>
            When I shared it with a few people, the response was clear: a lot of contributors were unsure whether their PRs had actually been accepted. They could not tell if a label had been applied, if their score had changed, or why two PRs with similar effort gave different points. This tool answers those questions directly.
          </P>
          <P>
            That is why I put it out for the community. It is not trying to replace the official tracker. It is a faster, more personal way to understand your own contributions.
